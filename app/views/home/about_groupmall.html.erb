        <p>GroupMall is a way to buy smart. We propose every week different offers up to 80% discount. How is that possible, you ask? Well, we cut all the intermediaries of the supply chain, offering you the best products directly coming from the importers or the local producers.</p>
      <p>
        <div>Why do we do that? Living in China is hard to find good quality products, especially imported ones, at affordable prices, we want to offer to the community the best options in the market while making people feel to have just closed a great deal on their favorite product. Our mission is to take away from the mind of people the issue of money when buying food, and just let them enjoy the happiness that only a good meal, shared with their family or friends, can give. </div>
